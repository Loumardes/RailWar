# RailWar Datapack

The datapack used to run the RailWar Minecraft Minigame

## Minigame overview

Railwar is inspired from Rush, but the only way to defeat the opposing team, is to destroy their core using a TNT_minecart

To achieve this, both teams will try to build their railway system over the void for delivering that explosive payload, but also to bring back to their base ressources carts along the way granting them an edge on the opposing team
